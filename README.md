# gScholarTabs
Fix opening entries from Google Scholar profiles in new tabs.

## Background
Many people like to save papers for later by opening them in new tabs via ctrl-click, middle click or the context menu.
For Google Scholar profiles however, this is only possible after first opening the paper entry.
Feel free to try it out [here](https://scholar.google.co.uk/citations?user=VWCHlwkAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao).
Depending on the browser, opening a new tab directly from a profile entry will either do nothing or - more annoyingly - open an empty tab.

## Description
This browser extension automatically converts the entries in Google Scholar profiles into proper links that can be opened in new tabs.

## Installation

### Manual Firefox Installation
* Dowlonad the Firefox extension file by clicking [here](https://github.com/rdroste/gScholarTabs/blob/master/google_scholar_tab_fixer-1.0-fx.xpi) and then clicking *Download*.

### Manual Chrome Installation
* Clone the repository or download and unzip the repository zip file (click "Code" and then "Download ZIP" on the top right).
* Copy the repository to a permanent location on your computer (any location is fine, just don't move it afterwards).
* In Chrome open the top-right menu, then click "More tools" -> "Extensions"
* Turn on "Developer Mode" on the top right
* Click "Load unpacked" and select the "gscholartabs" folder inside this repository (not the "gScholarTabs" folder of the repository itself)
* Finished! The extensin should now be working and shown in the list of extensions.
* Optional: If you want to delete the downloaded repository, remove the unpacked extension, click "Pack extension" and select the "gscholartabs" folder as before.
This will create a "gscholartabs.crx" file in the "gscholartabs" folder.
Drag it into the Chrome Extension manager to install the packed extension.
You can now delete the repository.
